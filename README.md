## 🙌🏻 iOS Engineer
I strive for continuous communication to pursue not only my own growth but also that of the team and the company. I always focus on the question "why" and foster efficient decision-making and problem-solving through sincere conversations with colleagues. Additionally, I actively share feedback and ideas while respecting and embracing my colleagues' opinions and ideas. I believe that these communication skills help me cultivate a culture of mutual respect and collaboration in the work environment, ultimately leading to better results.
